## Publishing to Terraform Registry

To publish the module to the Terraform registry create a release in the GitHub repository.

The new version will automatically be available at [exasol/exasol-test-setup/aws](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/exasol/exasol-test-setup/aws/latest) in the registry.
